Astro uses the `<a>` tag for links, similar to HTML. However, if you want to create a link that navigates within your Astro application without causing a full page reload (like React's `Link` component), you can use the `Astro.fetchContent()` function to fetch the content of another page and display it.

Here's an example of how to create a link in Astro:

```astro
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

This will create a link to the `/about` page of your application.

If you want to create a link that fetches content from another page and displays it without a full page reload, you can use `Astro.fetchContent()` like this:

```astro
---
// Fetch the content of the about page
const aboutPage = Astro.fetchContent('/about.astro');
---

<a href="/about" onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  document.body.innerHTML = aboutPage.html;
}}>About</a>
```

This will prevent the default link behavior (which is to navigate to the URL and reload the page), fetch the HTML of the about page, and replace the body's HTML with it.

Please note that `Astro.fetchContent()` is a server-side function and won't work on the client side. If you want to create a single-page application (SPA) experience with Astro, you might want to consider using a client-side router like `@reach/router` or `wouter`.
