    I am a somewhat experienced web developer who has explored very wide and far
    to find the best music since when I was still in elementary school, put into
    motion by a Tiesto album and rocket launched after hearing the first
    (mainstream) hardcore tracks my sister played on the computer.üîäüé∂ I
    remember very vividly the hardcore kicks and was sold immediately into
    finding out more of that good stuff I never heard before. üöÄ (I've grown out
    of the taste for mainstream hardcore pretty fast, don't expect any kind of
    mainstream of anything here).

  <p>
    This website has 1 single target audience and that's myself, I'm building
    the website I wanted to have 25 years ago.

  <p>I am open for suggestions!</p>

        If we‚Äôre talking about someone whose main goal is to spread his vision
        and beliefs about hardcore and to present the underground styles to the
        world, it will be DAEDRA.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using his emotions and thoughts and combining elements from many
        different genres within and outside of the hard dance, DAEDRA creates
        his sound. DAEDRA‚Äôs style can be described as dark, rough yet harmonic,
        melodic and with the underlying focus of rhythm and hard hitting
        percussive sounds. With that being said, remember the following‚Ä¶
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as the underground breathes, DAEDRA lives to spread the message
        even further.
