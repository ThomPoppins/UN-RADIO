    This website is in early development phase, but I'm live anyway, deal with
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a somewhat experienced web developer who has explored very wide and far
    to find the best music since when I was still in elementary school, put into
    motion by a Tiesto album and rocket launched after hearing the first
    (mainstream) hardcore tracks my sister played on the computer.ðŸ”ŠðŸŽ¶ I
    remember very vividly the hardcore kicks and was sold immediately into
    finding out more of that good stuff I never heard before. ðŸš€ (I've grown out
    of the taste for mainstream hardcore pretty fast, don't expect any kind of
    mainstream of anything here).
  </p>

  <p>
    This website has 1 single target audience and that's myself, I'm building
    the website I wanted to have 25 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>I am open for suggestions!</p>

  <p>
    Send anything interesting in an e-mail to <a

  <p>Much love, <br />T</p>
