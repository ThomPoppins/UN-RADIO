    Umami's YouTube channel is a captivating journey into creativity, mainly
    featuring the ongoing "Interface" series. The animations are visually
    stunning, with a unique style using 15 frames per second, a limited color
    palette, and a lower resolution for a distinct feel. The music plays a
    significant role, guiding the stories with a mesmerizing harmony.
  </p>

  <p>
    The channel offers a multisensory experience, u m a m i's content goes
    beyond visuals, exploring deep themes like coping mechanisms, death, grief,
    and personal struggles in the "Interface" series.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the artistic process remains mysterious, u m a m i's animations
    reflect the artist's mastery. The channel is not just a content platform but
    a portal into the mind of a creative genius. Each video, with its

  <h3>Read this text below AFTER watching the Interface movie:</h3>

  <p>
    Interface is a web series by Umami that revolves around a significant event
    known as the Philadelphia Experiment, which took place in 1943. During this
    experiment, a military vessel tested an experimental stealth cloaking
    technology, likely quantum mechanical in nature. However, the device
    malfunctioned, leading to unintended consequences for both the crew and the
    world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The malfunction triggered an event revealing a new force called "cerebral
    electricity." This force is essentially the physical energy of
    consciousness, generated by living things and released when they die. As a
    result of the experiment, most of the crew was fused with the ship, and only
    three survivors emerged: Henryk Niebieski, Percy (Mischief), and Joseph
    Greetings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Percy, technically dying in his original human form, managed to "regain his
    physicality" and became a new form of entity composed of cerebral
    electricity, known as Mischief. This incident led to the manifestation of
    spectral cerebral entities worldwide, plaguing the world with ghosts and
    monsters, and altering the skies and seas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joseph Greetings, one of the survivors, founded the Greetings robotics
    corporation to study cerebral electricity. They created KAMI, a machine
    designed to hunt cerebral entities, harvest their cerebral electricity, and
    catalogue it. The collected data was then uploaded to a flying database
    called the mechanical saccorhytus. Humanity used technology to harness this
    new force, driving back the spectral entities, though some found ways to
    integrate and hide within cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Henryk, left in an odd state between life and death, became immortal and
    lost in time. The plot involves the intertwined lives of Henryk, Mischief,
    and Greetings, exploring their pasts and personal connections. Greetings
    envisions merging all cerebral electricity into a single form, possibly to
    ascend to godhood or save lost minds. He builds the vessel, KAMI, to collect
    and absorb cerebral electricity, eventually sacrificing himself to create a
    homunculus god.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story explores the consequences of purging the world of perceived
    monsters, only to create a greater threat. Mischief ultimately sacrifices
    himself to sabotage the homunculus god, leaving the outcome ambiguous. The
    series concludes with the world returning to a semblance of normalcy but
    forever changed.
