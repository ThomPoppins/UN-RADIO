_Album description on bandcamp:_

**My Dear’s new album is a joyful organic mess peppered with shouts, rustles and bleats. It is dense and lively, mixing opera singing and metal screaming. Using real instruments, Ruby My Dear takes you through a brutal fantasy at the margins of breakcore, where jazz meets hunting horn meets classical music. Following on from Maigre, Brame goes further to create a new teeming and mind-blowing world, in which Ruby My Dear invited talented artists like Igorrr (guitars & mastering), Laure Le Prunenec (vocals) and Anthony Miranda from Pryapisme (flute). Brame will be out on January 30th on PRSPCT.

Featuring : Igorrr (Metal Blade), Laure Le Prunenec (Igorrr, Corpo Mente), Anthony Miranda (Priapisme), Jules Ribis (Sec), MC Noia, Emilie Chick.

Artwork: Darkam
Mastering: Igorrr**
