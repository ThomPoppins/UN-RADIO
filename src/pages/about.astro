      <p>
        Who can still imagine that time when there was no UN-RADIO? Here's a
        summary of how such a masterpiece comes to life. Get ready for a
        delicious dose of inspiration that awaits you‚ÄîI'm already getting warm
        just thinking about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Provide yourself with some background music and start this video
          before you start this way too long story!</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Approach:</h3>
      <p>
        If you're an experienced software or web developer like me, you
        understand well that you can't just randomly start a project of this
        magnitude. If you don't even have the idea of what it is in its entirety
        that you're going to build in a structured and coordinated way, it's
        impossible to estimate where to start. You can't implement "nothing"
        into "nothing." Also, you can't lay the groundwork for something you
        don't know because there is no general foundation for the "unknown."
        That foundation already exists, and I'm literally talking about the
        technology we're working with that is suitable for "general use." Even
        `npm init` (for the JS & Node.js experts), an action that is usually
        skipped, although I don't rule out that there are JS developers who have
        different experiences, it wouldn't exist for no reason. Software design
        was extremely important to be completely thought out before the
        development process could begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had to make sure that this project could go into production before the
        deadline I set, the deadline being "Before the end of my life." It comes
        with enormous stakes.
      </p>

      <h3>The idea:</h3>
      <p>
        The idea is very clear. I am a developer and enjoy listening to
        non-mainstream music. You know what? I'm going to create a music blog.
      </p>

      <p>
        I knew right away that it's an incorrect term that I'm giving it because
        I already knew that on this "blog," I would never write daily messages
        about how my day has been. But until now, it's still not clear to me
        what term I can give it. So, I decided to go full steam ahead for a
        better world for at least a few hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay, I'm already bored writing this "into production release note, a
        moment ago I felt motivation and a complete story to write down for
        everybody, but after this much it already feels like very much boring
        work and generally I do never do somethig I don't feel like doing and on
        the other hand I always do what I like to do and basically do whatever I
        want, I need a secretary for this, if you are interested fo fulfill this
        role in such an high-end environment on volentarly basis, don't hesitate
        to contact me and maybe you will find the exact place you want to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can always use a good assisteny especially because of my physical
        condition I suffer feeling tyred and discomfort working on boring stuff
        or any other stuff that is not appealing to me and that is exactly where
        you come in and SAVE THE DAY!
      </p>

      <p>Working for me wouldn't make you an assistent, you'd be a HERO!</p>

      <p>Well... let me know if you think about it.üòä</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Lastly will <stronga>promise</stronga> that this release note will contain
      complete information before the deadline expires!

    <h3>üéµ Unlocking Musical Freedom</h3>
    <p>
      If most of the music you know has been from mainstream radio or suggested
      by commercial services/apps, you might not have realized that your freedom
      of choice and which things to love may not be truly your own. Perhaps
      discovering new music by making some time in your schedule and going on a
      journey of exploration could lead you to something you'd love even more
      than you ever thought possible. If you have never tried this... Doesn't it
      make sense to start doing that? üåç Way much more than half of the people
      on earth find music important in their lives, so I hope this idea could
      inspire someone to get started with the same thing I have done from a very
      young age. It comes natural to me, mostly because the music on the radio
      always annoyed me because the much bigger bunch of it was boring to me.
    </p>
    <h3>üîÑ Breaking the Repetition Cycle</h3>
    <p>
      The fact is that I hate hearing some songs being repeatedly played like
      every hour, and hearing a song even 4 times a day is way too often and way
      and way and way too often. I really don't get people accepting this from
      happening to them‚Äîliterally being shoved some selected songs down their
      throats again and again and again without stopping for months per track
      and always having certain tracks to repeat endlessly. ü§î I asked people
      lots of times if they find that annoying, and if they still enjoy that
      certain song I heard over and over, and most people say they are used to
      it but are not enjoying it anymore after literally hearing it for 50+
      times. üìª I have to conclude that these commercial radio stations behaving
      themselves this way to their own listeners have lots of power because for
      many, there is no alternative, and they are forced to listen to it in a
      certain and common situation in their lives. Finding new music that is
      really easy on the ears of many and even give people energy and party
      vibes, if you think it is hard to find such...
    </p>
    <p>You're welcome!</p>
    <p>
      This is how easy it is to find real good music that is not boring as all
      like that mainsteam sheeple radio shit looping the same shit endlessly
      over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are you? What are we? Do we have to obey the music selection of the
      mainstream media without even realizing it? Why do so few people look
      further then what is being promoted and endlessly repeated to infinity.
      Are you sure you're not sheep?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in a "party" mood or need to concentrate on work and need something in
      the background? I understand when listening to the music isn't your
      priority that you'd turn on some radio station and get to work hearing
      those same tracks over and over and over and over and over again
      endlessly. There is <strong
        >so much music in the world that you can not even come close to listen
        2% of it!</strong
      > Begint er nu een lampje te branden waar ik het over heb?
    </p>
    <h4>Werk/studie muziek</h4>
    <p>
      Zet deze mix maar eens op als achtergrondmuziek, volume niet heel hoog
      maar als achtergrondmuziek. Waarom komt deze muziek <strong
        >absoluut niet</strong
      > op de radio denk je? Waarom komt deze muziek hoe dan ook niet in de
      buurt van "goed genoeg" om eens op radio te draaien, dat terwijl deze
      muziek bij menig mens prima naar te luisteren is....?
    </p>
    <p>Wat denk je?</p>
    <p>
      Omdat het <strong>niet genoeg geld opleverd.</strong> Dat terwijl het echt
      zeer goede muziek is die door menig mens gewaardeerd zal worden, al
      helemaal ter afwisseling van diezelfde plaat die <strong>elk uur</strong>
       gedraaid wordt. Ik wordt er gewoon knettergek van en werken zonder
      koptelefoon is voor mij geen optie op een kantoor die radio 586, SlamFM en
      zelfs 3FM echt geen optie is voor mij omdat ik namelijk altijd goed
      luister naar muziek en als die muziek <strong
        ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITkm-sBHH8"
          >vaak BEHOORLIJK tekortschiet en dan werkelijk zo'n plaat als achter
          deze link ELK UUR opnieuw gedraaid wordt...</a
        > Ja dan wordt ik natuurlijk letterlijk gestoord.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Ik weet zeker dat er mensen op mijn blog zullen landen die van mening
      zullen zijn dat ze niet eens in de buurt willen komen bij mensen die naar
      dit soort

      <i>"veelal onsamenhangende teringherrie"</i> luisteren, maar ik ben blij
      dat ik niet zo iemand ben en wel dusdanig objectief muziek kan beoordelen
      en er lekker mijn voordeel mee kan doen. Iedereen moet lekker vinden wat
      ie vind, maar muziekwise heb ik de beste smaak, ik ben buitegewoon goed in
      het herkennen van ethetische schoonheid dat er sprake moge zijn van
      hoogontwikkelde sensitiviteit artistieke schoonheid te herkennen. Ik zal
      deze gave niet slechts voor mij alleen houden en jullie delen wat voor
      schoonheid ik allemaal tref terwijl ik soundcloud en bandcamp af crawl op
      zoek naar het beste van het beste. Voor nu zal dat veel electronische
      muziek betekenen dus als dat niet je ding is dan kan je beter gaan en over
      een paar jaar nog eens kijken, of wegblijven net wat jij wil. Niemand
      hoeft op mijn blog te zijn en muziek beluisteren hier is echt op eigen
      initiatief dus ga niet lopen mouwen dat het kutmuziek is want dat is het
      niet dat heb ik vastgesteld als muziekexpert.
    </p>
    <p>Nu ff een snelle headbanger:</p>
    <strong>Hoppaaa, gas der op en programmmeren met die handel!</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    Programmeren? Ja programmeren, dat is wat ik doe op deze muziek, ik bouw een
    feestje en een dikke applicatie met een MERN stack helemaal zelf en al
    headbangend leer ik mijzelf in een half jaar een complete full stack
    JavaScript framework aan waardoor ik echt alles kan maken wat ik maar kan
    verzinnen en ik ga daar lekker mee door zelfstandig met lekker beukmuziek
    die me lekker gaande houdt want ik ga goed geld verdienen, ik ga daar niet
    mee stoppen tot
  </p>
  <h3>üåê Discovering Musical Freedom</h3>
  <p>
    I am not mad about it or angry really because there are places on the
    internet like
    <i>Soundcloud</i> and <i>Bandcamp</i> and even <i>Youtube</i> providing
    their service to any artist to publish their sound, and I am very content
    with that. I am very happy that I have found a way to discover new music for
    free‚Äîfree because the producer of the music decided that it should be
    possible to listen to their hard work to perfection and not expect anything
    in return from someone like me profiting off their creation. üéß The artists
    I listen to have that kind of mindset and are mostly happy with the fact
    that I or whoever appreciates the music the way they would make it without
    any commercial interest.
  </p>
  <h3>üíñ Gratitude to Music Creators</h3>
  <p>
    If you are publishing your music on a platform like <i>Soundcloud</i> or <i
      >Bandcamp</i
    >, you are not expecting to make money from it and you are not expecting to
    be famous from it. You are just sharing your creation with the world and
    hope someone (or many) will like it‚Äîbeing the way you think the music should
    sound, and the result is ready to be published because of your personal
    satisfaction. I will thank you deeply from my heart because if people like
    you did not exist, I would miss an important piece of my life that is often
    responsible for a mood change from unmotivated to energetic and providing me
    with fuel just by playing something you worked on. üé∂ I can also become
    happy from sad by being touched by mostly a new piece of music I hear, and
    there are even times I feel becoming emotional from music‚Äîmost of the times
    not even by a vocal message but from a level of perfection that I feel
    grateful to have the right and situation I am able to observe and listen and
    being aware some people don't even have means to be able to experience what
    I do at that time.
  </p>
  <h3>üì¢ Open Ears, Open Heart:</h3>
  <p>
    I think I told enough about myself and personal experience and relationship
    with music and even the producers of it in my heart enabling me to
    experience. If you think all music on this website sucks, I'm sorry, you are
    not alone at all. Sucks for you because if you did like it very much, you
    would have a place to go where you would get easily provided something new
    and beautiful without even the effort finding it that I did for you. I will
    never post anything I do not find beautiful enough, but please suggest me
    anything and I will be open to it except for such big commercial musicians
    and labels not gaining any noticeable effect from someone like me sharing
    their music and put them in a spotlight. Probably I hate their music anyway,
    but don't hold back, share even if you have doubts. üé§ I really do research
    into any suggestion and even click often on music I come across that gave me
    an impression that it probably sucks, and almost always it does, but I have
    had exceptions to this rule so there is not really a choice to "miss"
    something genius because of its cover for example.
