    {'"'}After two years of absence we are finally get back for a new
    season!
  </p>
  <p>
    So it's Bobby Starchild who starts the hostilities with "Stay Happy",
    a 4 tracks breakcorish EP which respects the madness but joyful
    traditions of this style.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Windy bangers comin your way" declared Bobby to the police officer
    who found him spreading the word on the streets of Leeds during the
    lockdown. The press later revealed that he was arrested supported by
    an army of gophers with an unusual quantity of ganja in their blood...
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of weird emotions have gone into this one and result a real
    happiness sensation with desire to give free rein to your madness.
  </p>
  <p>To illustrate it we got an amazing artwork by Danskezart{'"'}</p>
