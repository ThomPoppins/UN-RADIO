## Rave

I would does **rave** mean actually? **Rave** refers to a large, often all-night dance party featuring electronic dance music, including genres like techno, house, and **hardcore**. **Raves** are known for their vibrant atmosphere, pulsating music, and a sense of community among attendees.

Therefore, "**Oldschool Hardcore Rave**" is classic forms of the **hardcore gabber** genre within the context of what to expect from a **rave** setting. Expect fast beats, aggressive sounds, and a nostalgic vibe evoking the **hardcore rave** scenes from the past. Additionally, anticipate "spacing" sounds, characterized by a unique and not very typical sense of psychedelic effects woven into the music.

### Acid

Consider the prevalence of **acid** sounds in **rave** music—sounds that have been aptly named for their distinctive quality. This **acid** sound, which I personally love (can't live without for too long), infuses the music with playfulness, mystical elements, and at times, a hint of sinister vibes, creating a captivating sound experience.

Play this incredible **oldschool gabber rave set** performed by the one and only **DJ Ruffneck**, the visionary behind the renowned **Hardcore Techno** record label.

If you'd like to listen more into the **artcore**, **Ruffneck Records** has it's (almost maybe) complete discography of releases on **Ruffneck**'s record label online open for anyone to listen without any registration or account necessary, completely unconditional and FREE. You only have to go to his [**Ruffneck Records** label bandcamp account page](https://ruffneck.bandcamp.com) and make a choice, you have plenty and will not be done listening new stuff over there for a very long time.

For me personally, the most remarkable aspect is that even after more than 17 years of listening to this **oldschool hardcore rave music**, it still feels as fresh and **inspiring** as the first time. The enduring joy it brings is a testament to the timeless and captivating nature of the music.

**Oldschool**, **Hardcore** and **Gabber** refer to a style of music that emerged in the late 1980s and gained prominence in the 1990s. If you don't know what any of those terms mean, it shouldn't be too hard to find out on the internet. I would encourage you to get more knowledge about it because you'll probably come across a lot of interesting new material doing so.

## **Bio-Forge (Predator & Leviathan): The Evolution of Hardcore Pioneers**

In the pulsating realm of Dutch hardcore/trancecore, the collaborative force known as Bio-Forge emerged in 1996, born from the creative minds of Predator and Leviathan. Their musical journey, intertwined with the Cenobite Records legacy, started as a cenobite collaboration project, marking the beginning of a remarkable partnership.

The duo, Predator and Leviathan, left an indelible mark on the hardcore scene, gracing events such as Hellraiser, Mysteryland Indoor, Thunderdome a Decade, and Global Hardcore Nation. Under various aliases and styles, Bio-Forge became synonymous with versatility, exploring the diverse landscapes of the hardcore genre.

A pivotal moment in their trajectory came with their inaugural vinyl release on the third Cenobite Records compilation. This milestone carried the weight of classics such as "No 1 S-capes Us," "We Know Your Fear," and "Turbulence" (By Predator Solo), solidifying Bio-Forge's presence in the hardcore hall of fame.

Predator, a stalwart in the hardcore scene, boasts a profound dedication to the genre, accentuated by his unmistakable drum ‘n bass preference. His hardcore journey began in 1992 when Stephan Scheltema (Predator) became a key artist on Ruffneck Records, contributing classics like “Mind of A Lunatic,” “The Strongest Gang,” and the iconic Diss Reaction track “Jieehaaaa.” After a period of exploring distorted hardcore sounds, Predator rediscovered his hardcore essence on Masters of Hardcore. This marked a resurgence, leading to the creation of hits like “The Switch,” “Demon Pit,” and “Legend.” Predator's reputation extends to his electrifying early hardcore sets and mainstream performances infused with a drum ‘n bass touch.

As the years progressed, the duo found themselves back in harmony, performing together once again, signaling a revival of the Bio-Forge legacy. Their enduring impact on the hardcore scene and commitment to pushing musical boundaries make Bio-Forge, with Predator and Leviathan at its core, a beacon in the ever-evolving world of hardcore music.

## **Hellraiser** 🔥🎶

When I was 18 years old, mainstream hardcore parties dominated the scene, but I considered myself lucky to share a bond with my best friend, both of us resisting the allure of generic beats. Our group may not have cared as much, but for us, finding an oldschool party with Cenobite DJs on the lineup was a quest worth undertaking. Successfully making our way to Amsterdam, we found ourselves at a by Hellraiser organized party, with our hero's behind the turning tables.

As the night unfolded, we felt a profound sense of belonging, surrounded by like-minded souls enjoying every second the music came towards us loud and fast. Leaving the venue that night, the beats of Cenobite did not leave my head for some time and practically never did, I will never forget that Cenobite sound and happy memory.

Here's a typical live set you can expect at Hellraiser. DJs Predator vs. Leviathan, not together under the name Bio-Forge, but both under their own names, have composed and recorded a live performance together, mixing the oh-so-typical Cenobite sounds one track after the other. There's a balanced constant in this session, constantly 'spacing you the f out as much as possible with 100% energy, deep and loud kicks coming your way violently and fast,' and 'go fast, never stop pounding and keep going and going and going,' a kind of way of composing their performances together.

## Liveset Predator vs. Leviathan from Cenobite Records

***This was the kind of rave that night the whole night kept going on and on and never winded down, 100% energy rave core spacing music and that was and is only way it should be in my opinion, party hard party please!***

## Authenticity Amidst Evolution: Old-School Hardcore Gabber's Enduring Legacy

The realm of old-school hardcore gabber stands as a testament to genuine passion-driven rave music production, a stark contrast to the current landscape dominated by mainstream hardcore events employing a standardized gabber style. In the past, artistic authenticity thrived, with DJs and producers skillfully crafting a unique sonic journey. This immersive experience aimed to transport the audience into an elevated state of consciousness, free from the confines of time and date.

**Crafting Timeless Journeys: The Essence of Old-School Rave Music:**

The essence lies in extending the euphoric and ecstasy-inducing sensations within the listener's body, devoid of predetermined constraints. The roots of inspiration delve into the golden era of rave music, finding resonance in labels such as Cenobite Records and kindred innovative artists. The focus shifts to those possessing the skill to not only induce a profound trance-like state but also sustain it for an extended duration, creating a lasting impact.

**A Shift in Harmony: Mainstream Hardcore's Homogeneous Landscape:**

This stands in stark contrast to the contemporary mainstream hardcore scene, where numerous DJs at events adopt an almost indistinguishable sound, differing only in minor nuances of melody. The present landscape, dominated by a homogeneous gabber style, lacks the diversity and genuine passion that defined the old-school hardcore era. In essence, the comparison between the two underscores the shift from authentic, passion-fueled artistry to a more formulaic and standardized approach in the pursuit of mainstream appeal.

**Nostalgic Embrace: Rediscovering Old-School Rave Music:**

Immersing oneself in the live mixes of music from labels such as Cenobite Records is a journey into a serene state of being, accompanied by waves of euphoria and a perpetual smile. The appeal lies in the nostalgic embrace of old-school rave music, a time when the hardcore scene catered to genuine ravers and authentic enthusiasts. This contrasts with the current mainstream hardcore movement, which often prioritizes mass appeal over individual artistry.

**Departure from Originality: Mainstream Hardcore's Unfortunate Evolution**

The shift from the authentic creativity of each artist and label to a homogenized sound performed by multiple mainstream hardcore DJs at events has left a void for those seeking a more personalized and original musical experience. The unfortunate consequence is an industry driven by the simplistic appeal of a generic beat and melody, designed to cater to a broad audience that may not appreciate the intricacies of a track beyond a basic rhythm. This departure from the roots of hardcore music, where artists crafted unique masterpieces tailored to their artistic vision and a specific audience, is a sentiment that many find disheartening.

The search for artists who remain true to their originality yields a rich tapestry of talent, where dedication to perfecting a distinctive sound is evident. The desire is not for products shaped by market demand, but rather for masterpieces meticulously crafted by artists committed to producing a sound that resonates profoundly with both themselves and a niche audience. In this exploration, one discovers a plethora of artists whose authenticity and creativity stand as a testament to the enduring allure of genuine, individualized musical expression. And that, in itself, is truly gratifying.

Mainstream hardcore has discarded the intricate elements perfected by old-school DJ/producers. The use of Acid, skillfully guiding the psychology of ravers to euphoric heights, was a hallmark of the past. Even now, the perfect blend of a deep kick and shaped Acid sounds in releases from [Cenobite Recordings]() still transports me to a relaxed state of mind. The loyalty I've held for this label for 17 years speaks to its enduring quality – a constant source of satisfaction akin to a comforting massage.

**The Decline of Old-School Gabber: A Nostalgic Lament:**

The demise of old-school gabber parties, replaced by a modern mainstream sound, is a perplexing shift. The beautiful, deep, almost analogic feeling kick that defined the era has been substituted with electronic sounds that fail to resonate. Modern mainstream hardcore, far from a continuation of the hypnotic, trance-inducing elements of the past, feels like a departure into something entirely new. Judging purely on the intrinsic qualities of the sound and its ability to transport, old-school and mainstream hardcore seem almost antithetical when viewed in isolation from their historical contexts.

### Techno's Unveiled Purpose: Crafting Top-Tier Rave Party Music

Recently, I discovered a niche in techno where artists and labels are dedicated solely to producing top-tier rave party music. Pulsating bass, deep and low, accompanied by the spinning up of acid sounds, evokes nostalgia for the old-school house and gabber parties of the '90s. The timeless appeal of raving to a unique, deep kick that seamlessly transitions from one recognizable sound to another remains unmatched.

These tracks showcase an early form of hardcore music, crafted by the producer/DJ Leviathan during his debut on Cenobite Records. Take a moment to distinguish it from the more popular mainstream hardcore, represented in the linked video. I won't pass judgment if mainstream is your preference, but it's worth acknowledging the distinct approach of old-school Cenobite production.

The Cenobite way of creating music is more than just beats; it paints an atmosphere that fills the room and elevates your consciousness. The trance-inducing speed and height of the acid wobble create a mystical experience, akin to a journey through different heights. The progression from ascent to descent, from heightened intensity to a gradual slowing, is like a mental reset. Old-school hardcore from the Cenobite label is a carefully thought-out psychological concept that induces a spaced-out sensation, even without substances, in contrast to the more straightforward kick and melody style of mainstream.

Mainstream tracks, may offer a similar energy but lack the nuanced brainwave dance that characterizes a journey into a mystical world. Mainstream tends to reuse sounds and rhythms across tracks to cater to a broader audience, aiming to sound appealing to the average person. This leads to a lack of artistic diversity, and personally, I wouldn't find much musical value in attending a mainstream hardcore party due to the overwhelming familiarity.

In the old-school era, raves attracted people for more than just the music; they offered a psychedelic vibe and a sense of meaning, almost bordering on a spiritual experience. Letting yourself go into the sound, allowing it to guide your trance, was considered a form of spirituality by some.
