# Allow Yourself to Struggle More 💪

**About this lengthy text: 📚**

Anyone interested can NOW pause the video and read the text. If you find my endless bookwork unnecessary, feel free to skip to the music of **Venetian Snares** and random footage of an amateurish, clumsy programmer slowly failing until everything breaks, despite seemingly putting in effort, which also seems like an interesting experience. 🤖🎶

# About this example video 🎥

## **DISCLAIMER** 🚫

I have no aspirations in video editing, and I couldn't care less about how unprofessional it is to include a Markdown document. It's a waste of time to give advice like "It's so easy to add text to a video blablablabla..." 🤷‍♂️

The beauty of the video is also that I didn't succeed, and that's okay. I got a bit tired of it, but until now, I haven't felt any need to compensate by grabbing a nice pre-made piece of animation from the internet or GPT. I'll just continue with it without a deadline, no pressure, enjoying what I find most enjoyable about programming, which is truly puzzling and trying to find a solution through _logical reasoning_ as long as I think I have enough knowledge to solve it. 🧠💡

The problem I mainly observe when I see myself is that the complete CSS is not structured. This was a problem arising from starting to **learn about Astro** COMPLETELY with no other goal than **to figure out what I can do with it out of the box without any introductory information etc.**. I find it fun; I don't have to succeed because it's a "challenge" whose level of achievement I may or may not expect to know beforehand, especially since I have no idea what I'm getting into. Effectively, I had tinkered with CSS, etc., without having read the beginning of the tutorial to see how it reacts to what is familiar to me. I had crammed so many CSS rules into a file that, at the time of this recording, I didn't realize it was hindering me so much that everything started to break due to the loss of overview. If I were paid per hour, I would work as efficiently as possible, knowing in advance how I would structure the entire styling file with only a few minor adjustments at the final result after. 🕵️‍♂️💻

So, in the future (when I feel like it), the first thing I'll do is structure that CSS because the interim goal of **creating a cool background animation with `CSS animation`** that I was working on during this video can reasonably be expected to be easily achieved. 🌐🚀

The joy I experience in just being busy without expectations from others or yourself, trying things calmly with a nice piece of music playing, is pleasant to do. It gives me the feeling that this is the most valuable learning experience I have consciously become aware of so far. Don't resort to Google too quickly; solve it yourself first and, of course, check whether everything has gone as **intended** (as described in reliable sources like the official Astro documentation, which often isn't exactly so, but you haven't lost anything, in fact, you've done a considerable mental exercise that will come in handy in the future. When I started the video, I didn't remember exactly how those animations worked, but I had one example in the file of an element I had previously provided with a standard animation when my goal wasn't to figure that out myself. So, every time, I optimally use the situation that arises when I try to **improve solution-oriented work literally through gaining experience**. It is understandable that if you work under time pressure, you are forced to work with Google and AI because it is expected. Still, you can easily spend half an hour a day in your free time, with a beer or whatever gives you a relaxed attitude, without expectations from yourself or others, just working on programming without external aids. As long as you inform yourself about things that are not realistic to work on without sources, like **finding out the installation command without sources**, that seems pointless because you would have to be improving clairvoyance for it to be a useful exercise for something, so as long as there are any possible solutions for you, keep busy and don't give up too quickly. ⏰🍺💻

I didn't think it was possible that I would do that for 56 minutes straight without realizing it and didn't even realize that it was long or continuous, simply **because I was just relaxing with an activity, and I aim to keep doing this my whole life in this way without any reason to have completed a tutorial that takes a few hours (and that's already generous) in less than a few weeks.** 🎮🤓

It seems remarkably unproductive, but where everyone puts together an empty, meaningless website, I've actually already achieved a kind of result for the website beyond any set goal. I've been busy exclusively for my own entertainment, and in the meantime, I know the basics of Astro as if it were **simply given** without labor. 🚀🌟

Don't get the impression that I'm here **seriously busy** even though it may seem that way. If you want to believe that I'm only saying this because I'm totally failing and not being honest about the fact that I'm just a thick newbie programmer who has never heard of Google, that's fine, and I hope you have a great day. 😄🌈
