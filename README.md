# Un-Radio

**Introduction:**

Welcome to **Un-Radio**. This website is under development by **ThomDev** and is just a personal project that came from an idea I had about people not ever knowing about the existence of music I love and listen to, and I'd like to share artistic creations with the world and hope somewhere in the future someone really likes what I share and played a role in liberating this person from the constraints the **mainstream music industry** always has kept hidden as much as possible and is unnoticeable for some person not being aware at all that the cosmos of music is so much bigger than even imaginable and is unlikely that you'll not find something more to your liking than the mainstream music industry has to offer.

## **Advice**

**üéµ Unlocking Musical Freedom:**

If most of the music you know has been from **mainstream radio** or suggested by commercial services/apps, you might not have realized that your freedom of choice and which things to love may not be truly your own. Perhaps discovering new music by making some time in your schedule and going on a journey of exploration could lead you to something you'd love even more than you ever thought possible. If you have never tried this... Doesn't it make sense to start doing that? üåç Way much more than half of the people on earth find music important in their lives, so I hope this idea could inspire someone to get started with the same thing I have done from a very young age. It comes natural to me, mostly because the music on the radio always annoyed me because the much bigger bunch of it was boring to me, and I hate up to the present day when I am in a situation radio is unavoidable or it would not be very social to turn it off for such a little unimportant annoyance.

**üîÑ Breaking the Repetition Cycle:**

The fact is that I hate hearing some songs being repeatedly played like every hour, and hearing a song even 4 times a day is way too often and way and way and way too often. I really don't get people accepting this from happening to them‚Äîliterally being shoved some selected songs down their throats again and again and again without stopping for months per track and always having certain tracks to repeat endlessly. ü§î I asked people lots of times if they find that annoying, and if they still enjoy that certain song I heard over and over, and most people say they are used to it but are not enjoying it anymore after literally hearing it for 50+ times. üìª I have to conclude that these commercial radio stations behaving themselves this way to their own listeners have lots of power because for many, there is no alternative, and they are forced to listen to it in a certain and common situation in their lives.

**üåê Discovering Musical Freedom:**

I am not mad about it or angry really because there are places on the internet like **Soundcloud** and **Bandcamp** and even **Youtube** providing their service to any artist to publish their sound, and I am very content with that. I am very happy that I have found a way to discover new music for free‚Äîfree because the producer of the music decided that it should be possible to listen to their hard work to perfection and not expect anything in return from someone like me profiting off their creation. üéß The artists I listen to have that kind of mindset and are mostly happy with the fact that I or whoever appreciates the music the way they would make it without any commercial interest.

**üíñ Gratitude to Music Creators:**

If you are publishing your music on a platform like **Soundcloud** or **Bandcamp**, you are not expecting to make money from it and you are not expecting to be famous from it. You are just sharing your creation with the world and hope someone (or many) will like it‚Äîbeing the way you think the music should sound, and the result is ready to be published because of your personal satisfaction. I will thank you deeply from my heart because if people like you did not exist, I would miss an important piece of my life that is often responsible for a mood change from unmotivated to energetic and providing me with fuel just by playing something you worked on. üé∂ I can also become happy from sad by being touched by mostly a new piece of music I hear, and there are even times I feel becoming emotional from music‚Äîmost of the times not even by a vocal message but from a level of perfection that I feel grateful to have the right and situation I am able to observe and listen and being aware some people don't even have means to be able to experience what I do at that time.

**Open Ears, üéµ Open Heart:**

I think I told enough about myself and personal experience and relationship with music and even the producers of it in my heart enabling me to experience. If you think all music on this website sucks, I'm sorry, you are not alone at all. Sucks for you because if you did like it very much, you would have a place to go where you would get easily provided something new and beautiful without even the effort finding it that I did for you. I will never post anything I do not find beautiful enough, but please suggest me anything and I will be open to it except for such big commercial musicians and labels not gaining any noticeable effect from someone like me sharing their music and put them in a spotlight. Probably I hate their music anyway, but don't hold back, share even if you have doubts. üé§ I really do research into any suggestion and even click often on music I come across that gave me an impression that it probably sucks, and almost always it does, but I have had exceptions to this rule so there is not really a choice to "miss" something genius because of its cover for example.

üåü If this doesn't quite match your vibe or you're not feeling it, no worries at all. Just do what feels right for you; I totally respect that. I only focus on things that matter to people.

**üé∂ Prepare yourself for an Un-Radio experience if you dare.**
